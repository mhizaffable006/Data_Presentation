# Data_Presentation

# Introduction
As part of assessment in the Data Analytics class organized by PSP_Analytics, one of the analytics projects Iâ€™ll be working on is the Bike_Buyers Dataset. The Bike_Buyers dataset contains the ID,	Marital Status, Gender,	Income,	Children,	Education,	Occupation,	Home Owner,	Cars,	Commute Distance,	Region,	Age and	Purchased Bike. The goal of this work is to analyze the performance and to uncover insights to be used for the business growth.

# Data Sourcing
This dataset used in this work is gotten from the Data Analytics Class announcement channel, which was posted by Mr. Kingsley Adisa.

# Data Preparation
We will load the data into MS Excel.

# Data Cleaning/Transformation
Here, we are to the following with the loaded dataset for analysis.

  1. Remove Duplicates
  2. Replace M and S in column 2 to Married and Single... And same for M and F using Male and Female in column 3
  3. Make sure the income column has values with '0' decimal places.
  4. Group the age into age brackets in a different column with adolescents (0-30), middle age (31-54), and old (55+). Tip: Use the 'IF' function.

# Data Analysis/Visualization
Using PIVOT tables and charts, we are to show the relationship between

  a. The average income of each gender and their bike purchase history

  b. Distance travelled by commuters and bike purchase

  c. Age bracket and bike purchase.

  d. From your analysis in c above, suggest which age bracket should be given less attention by the Bike Manufacturers.

    The Age Brackets of Adolescents should be given less attention by the Bike Manufacturers because, they have lesser values for those who purchased bikes.

# Reporting
In the reporting, we are to:

  1. Create a mouth-watering dashboard with atleast three slicers.

  2. With the slicer, explain the behavior of European Middle age singles on Bike purchase.
 
  3. With the slicer, deduce which academic qualification earns more.

# Conclusion
The resulting dashboard built from Excel is shown below:
